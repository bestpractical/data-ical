=head1 NAME

Data::ICal - Generates iCalendar (RFC 2445) calendar files


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::ICal;

    my $calendar = Data::ICal->new();

    my $vtodo = Data::ICal::Entry::Todo->new();
    $vtodo->add_properties(
        # ... see Data::ICal::Entry::Todo documentation
    );

    # ... or

    $calendar = Data::ICal->new(filename => 'foo.ics'); # parse existing file
    $calendar = Data::ICal->new(data => 'BEGIN:VCALENDAR...'); # parse existing file


    $calendar->add_entry($vtodo);

    print $calendar->as_string;
   
=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<Data::ICal> object represents a C<VCALENDAR> object as defined in the
iCalendar protocol (RFC 2445, MIME type "text/calendar"), as implemented in many
popular calendaring programs such as Apple's iCal.

Each L<Data::ICal> object is a collection of "entries", which are objects of a
subclass of L<Data::ICal::Entry>.  The types of entries defined by iCalendar
(which refers to them as "components") include events, to-do items, journal
entries, free/busy time indicators, and time zone descriptors; in addition,
events and to-do items can contain alarm entries.  (Currently, L<Data::ICal>
only implements to-do items and events.)

L<Data::ICal> is a subclass of L<Data::ICal::Entry>; see its manpage for more
methods applicable to L<Data::ICal>.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 new [ data => $data, ] [ filename => $file ], [ vcal10 => $bool ]

Creates a new L<Data::ICal> object. 

If it is given a filename or data argument is passed, then this parses the
content of the file or string into the object.  If the C<vcal10> flag is passed,
parses it according to vCalendar 1.0, not iCalendar 2.0; this in particular impacts
the parsing of continuation lines in quoted-printable sections.

If a filename or data argument is not passed, this just sets its C<VERSION> and
C<PRODID> properties to "2.0" (or "1.0" if the C<vcal10> flag is passed) and
the value of the C<product_id> method respectively.

Returns a false value upon failure to open or parse the file or data; this false
value is a L<Class::ReturnValue> object and can be queried as to its 
C<error_message>.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self  = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

    my %args = (
        filename => undef,
        data     => undef,
        vcal10   => 0,
        @_
    );

    $self->vcal10($args{vcal10});

    if (defined $args{filename} or defined $args{data}) {
        # might return a Class::ReturnValue if parsing fails
        return $self->parse(%args);
    } else {
        $self->add_properties(
            version => ($self->vcal10 ? '1.0' : '2.0'),
            prodid  => $self->product_id,
        );
        return $self;
    }
}

=head2 parse [ data => $data, ] [ filename => $file, ]

Parse a .ics file or string containing one, and populate C<$self> with
its contents.

Should only be called once on a given object, and will be automatically
called by C<new> if you provide arguments to C<new>.

Returns C<$self> on success.
Returns a false value upon failure to open or parse the file or data; this false
value is a L<Class::ReturnValue> object and can be queried as to its 
C<error_message>.

} 

=head2 ical_entry_type

Returns C<VCALENDAR>, its iCalendar entry name.

=cut

sub ical_entry_type {'VCALENDAR'}

=head2 product_id

Returns the product ID used in the calendar's C<PRODID> property; you may
wish to override this in a subclass for your own application.

=cut

=head2 mandatory_unique_properties

According to the iCalendar standard, the following properties must be specified
exactly one time for a calendar:

      prodid version

        prodid version
    );
}

=head2 optional_unique_properties

According to the iCalendar standard, the following properties may be specified
at most one time for a calendar:

      calscale method

=cut

sub optional_unique_properties {
    qw(
        calscale method

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

L<Data::ICal> requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<Data::ICal> requires L<Class::Accessor>.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

L<Data::ICal> does not support time zone daylight or standard entries, so time zone
components are basically useless.

While L<Data::ICal> tries to check which properties are required and repeatable, this
only works in simple cases; it does not check for properties that must either both exist
or both not exist, or for mutually exclusive properties.

L<Data::ICal> does not check to see if property parameter names are known in
general or allowed on the particular property.

L<Data::ICal> does not check to see if nested entries are nested properly (alarms in
todos and events only, everything else in calendars only).

The only property encoding supported by L<Data::ICal> is quoted printable.

There is no L<Data::ICal::Entry::Alarm> base class.

No bugs have been reported.
