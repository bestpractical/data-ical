    * The recur type is defined in section 4.3.10 in RFC2445.

    This type is separated by comma or semicolon as shown in "description"
    part of this section;

    | multiple "recur" values are specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII
    decimal 44) separated list of values.

    | The rule parts are separated from each other by the SEMICOLON
    character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

    At the middle of this section, an example is presented;

    | RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1

    See http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/recur.html
